    "This notebook will briefly present *Bayesian spam filtering*, which is an established and effective technique for spam filtering.  The basic idea is to look at documents as *bags of words* (that is, as mappings of words to frequencies, disregarding ordering).  The underlying assumption is that spam and legitimate documents will have different distributions of words, and that we'll be able to rate the probability that a given set of words came from a legitimate document or a spam document.

A common way to fool Bayesian spam filters is to append a lot of legitimate text to the end of a spam document.
