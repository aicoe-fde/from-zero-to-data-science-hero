    "#### Dealing with Imbalanced Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "When the training data set contains unequal representation from each of your classes we say we are dealing with 'imbalanced classes'. In our data set fewer than 2% of the samples are fraudulent, and the remaining 98% are legitimate. Thus we have imbalanced classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This causes problems for a few reasons:\n",
    "1. A model which classifies all transactions as 'legitimate' would be correct 98% of the time. This high accuracy can trick you into thinking that your model is working well, despite it just returning 'legitimate' for every sample it sees. \n",
    "2. Even if your model tries to learn patterns in the data, it may struggle to learn from the 'fraudulent' data since there simply isn't enough of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few approaches we could take to tackle the problem, and today we will use two of them: \n",
    "1. We will use metrics which are more informative than simply counting how often the model makes a correct prediction. \n",
    "2. We will weight the samples by the inverse of the frequency of their label within the data set. These weights will be passed into the logistic regression model, and used to ensure that the model is penalised proportionally to this weight for making a misclassification for each class when it is training. \n",
    "\n",

    "In this next cell we compute these weights for each of the data labels. "
