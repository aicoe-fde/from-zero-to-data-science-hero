    "Perhaps you've played [Twenty Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions) before:  it's a game where one player (the *answerer*) thinks of a person, place, or thing, and other players ask yes-or-no questions to guess the object of the answerer's thoughts.  Since the answerer probably knows about a lot of different people and objects, a good strategy for the other players involves devising questions that reduce the space of possible answers as much as possible no matter how they are answered.\n",

    "Given a labeled collection of examples, you might imagine a technique to [learn a *decision tree*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) of questions to classify these examples by asking as few questions as possible.  However, you might imagine that such a technique would necessarily be quite dependent on the exact examples on offer.  (In other words,  these techniques are prone to *overfitting*.)  As a simple illustration,  consider the case where your set of example objects was `{'ant', 'elephant'}`.  In this case, the question \\\"is it smaller than a typical adult human\\\" would enable you to differentiate between examples optimally.   However, that question would be useless if our set of example objects was the set of all domesticated dog breeds.\n",

    "[Random decision forest models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) work by training an *ensemble* of imprecise decision trees that only consider subsets of features or examples and then aggregating the results from the ensemble.  By learning and aggregating an ensemble of trees, random decision forests can be more accurate than individual decision trees *and* are less likely to overfit.  In this notebook, we'll use a random decision forest to classify transactions as either 'fraudulent' or 'legitimate'.\n",

    "#### Dealing with Imbalanced Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "When the training data set contains unequal representation from each of your classes we say we are dealing with 'imbalanced classes'. In our data set fewer than 2% of the samples are fraudulent, and the remaining 98% are legitimate. Thus we have imbalanced classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This causes problems for a few reasons:\n",
    "1. A model which classifies all transactions as 'legitimate' would be correct 98% of the time. This high accuracy can trick you into thinking that your model is working well, despite it just returning 'legitimate' for every sample it sees. \n",
    "2. Even if your model tries to learn patterns in the data, it may struggle to learn from the 'fraudulent' data since there simply isn't enough of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us we can account for this class imbalance by passing the parameter `class_weight = balanced_subsample` into our model. \n",
    "\n",
