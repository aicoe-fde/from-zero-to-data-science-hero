# From Statistics to Serverless: Machine Learning on OpenShift 4

This repository contains the materials from a hands-on tutorial on machine learning workflows using OpenShift 4. 

The workshop steps through the machine learning workflow for the concrete use case of detecting fraudulent transactions.

The goal of this workshop is to show application developers how data scientists approach a problem, illustrate some pain points data scientists have, and highlight ways in which OpenShift makes the machine learning workflow easier. 

This lab was presented by @sophwats, @willb and @mbogoevici at Red Hat Summit in April 2020 and at IBM Think in May 2020.
