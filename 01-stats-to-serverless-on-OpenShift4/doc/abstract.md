# From statistics to serverless: building intelligent applications on OpenShift 4


Applications that learn from data and user interactions to deliver business value are increasingly important to users and enterprises alike. Developer teams are ultimately responsible for creating and managing these intelligent applications, and OpenShift provides an unbeatable platform to support them. This hands-on lab will show you how the machine learning workflow naturally fits into your general software development practice, how cross-functional teams build intelligent applications, and how the serverless capabilities of the platform enable agile, efficient, and economical data and learning pipelines. We’ll show you:

how OpenShift streamlines the path from discovery to production for data scientists and developers alike,
the advantages of serverless for machine learning systems,
how to train, evaluate, and publish models in a contemporary serverless architecture,
how to monitor models in production and detect failures before they cause problems, and
how to start incorporating intelligent features into your apps.

We’ll do all of this on an open-source stack including OpenShift, the Open Data Hub, Knative, and Red Hat’s developer tools portfolio. Application developers will leave this session equipped to build apps that depend on machine learning; machine learning engineers and data scientists will leave this session prepared to take full advantage of OpenShift 4 for their daily work. All attendees will develop an understanding of how OpenShift supports both data science discovery and production machine learning systems.
