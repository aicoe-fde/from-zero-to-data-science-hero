We want a representation that makes sure that manual transactions are similar to other manual transactions in some way _but dissimilar to all other transactions_ in that way.\n",

(t-SNE also works best for visualizing two-dimensional data when it is reducing from tens of dimensions rather than hundreds or thousands.  So, in some cases, you'll want to use a fast technique like PCA to reduce your data to a few dozen dimensions before using t-SNE.  That's what we're doing with the `TruncatedSVD` class in the next cell.)\n",
